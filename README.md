# User Factory!

Look inside start.js - you will find a large array of data. This data describes users. Your job, should you choose to accept it, is to create a function (or functions) that covert this kind of data to user objects!

Each user should contain the following properties; `id`, `fullName`, `initials`, `birthYear` and `departments`. The `deparments` property should contain an array of strings. If some of the information is not available, its corresponding property should have the value "Unknown".

We need each user object to be stored in an array of users objects. Once you have ran your function (or functions), log the resulting array into your workstation terminal where a highly trained monkey will examine it for further processing. Perhaps even the very same monkey writing out these instructions.

*bonus* We also need another, more different, function that gives us a list of all the departments found in the data dump, in alphabetical order.
